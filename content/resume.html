                    As the most senior engineer on a team responsible for the overall observability
                    of Etsy's systems, I took on a role of technical leadership. While I did
                    implement solutions myself as needed, my focus was on developing the skills
                    of junior engineers, communicating across team boundaries, and ensuring that
                    our team's work was well organized and well planned.

                    <li>Collaborated with compliance engineers and auditors to redesign SOX

                    <li>Directed the homogenization of disparate Kubernetes-resident Prometheus

                <div class="resume-job-summary">
                    I joined Exosite, a Minneapolis-based Internet of Things startup, as its first
                    full-time operations engineer. As the company rapidly grew, my responsibilities
                    ranged from software performance analysis to drafting security policy to
                    implementing customer-facing IoT applications. But I was always, first and
                    foremost, an ops engineer.

                <div class="resume-job-summary">
                    When the manager of Blue State's web operations team left the company, I applied
