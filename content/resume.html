                As the most senior engineer on a team responsible for the overall observability
                of Etsy's systems, I took on a role of technical leadership. While I did
                implement solutions myself as needed, my focus was on developing the skills
                of junior engineers, communicating across team boundaries, and ensuring that
                our team's work was well organized and well planned.

                I joined Exosite, a Minneapolis-based Internet of Things startup, as its first
                full-time operations engineer. As the company rapidly grew, my responsibilities
                ranged from software performance analysis to drafting security policy to
                implementing customer-facing IoT applications. But I was always, first and
